# Data Wrangling 304
*Spring 2025*
Meets: MWF 1240-1330 {location t.b.d.}
Instructor: Ephy Love {utk email}
Office Hours: {after class MF?}
## Course Description
This course covers the all-important data “wrangling” process, taking data from real-world sources and converting the data into easily-accessible format for analysis. The course covers the steps of the data wrangling process like importing data, tidying data, string processing, HTML parsing, working with dates and times, and text mining. We will consider databases as well as data extracted from documents.
## Prerequisites
There are no official prerequisites for this course. However, familiarity with a high level programming language such as Python or R will be very helpful.
## Course Objective
After you have completed this course, you should feel comfortable taking on data analysis and data science tasks with arbitrary data sources. It won't matter to you how complicated and messy the data are, you'll have an instinctive toolset for how to go from 0 to 1 in the. data investigation process. Specifically, we will cover:
1. Why we automate data wrangling
2. How we automate data wrangling
3. Structured vs unstructured data
4. Experimental data analysis
5. Experimental data analysis  
6. Cleaning data (fine-tuning)
7. Final project
In the final project for this course {}
## Required Materials

## Assignments and Assessments
### Homework
Homework assignments must be turned in to Canvas on-time (5 PM on the due-date) to receive any credit. If you have a reason you must turn an assignment in late, contact me as early as possible so that we can discuss.
### Final Project
Roughly 1/3 of course credit comes from your final project. Your project will require you choosing from a set of unstructured/semi-structured datasets (websites, encyclopedias, open datasets), and creating a 10 minute presentation demonstrating:
1. Your approach to organizing your data and code
2. Any tricky cleaning that had to be done
3. An interesting insight you gleaned from the data
I will grade this work as if I am your supervisor in an internship, and you are telling me why I should offer you a job in the summer. You will be graded on the complete package: organization, presentation and usefulness of the knowledge you bring me.
### Attendance
Show up to class, pay attention, participate here and there, and get 20% of course points. The final few weeks of the course will be dedicated to your projects
### General expectations
*Be respectful of your peers and I*.
*Show up to class on time or do not show up.* 
*Keep phones away and on silent.*
*Do the work.*
If you follow these expectations, I will do everything I can to help you be successful.
## Grading Policy
This class is graded out of 100 possible points. If you do all of the homework and show up to class, you will pass. If you want high marks, you should be focused on your final project early and use office hours to begin planning and work.
